# projetMeteorReact
- Create an app that renders a list of Student with ReactJS and meteor/Mongo DB.
- You can add students, edit or delete them. (CRUD)
- You need to be connected to update (add/edit) the list.
- You can create an account and sign in/sign out.
- We also added some security to make sure that not every user can edit any part of the database.
